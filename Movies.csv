Eager to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and her daughters Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) and Drisella (Sophie McShera) into the family home. But, when Ella's father unexpectedly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella, Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother's dying words and to ""have courage and be kind."" She will not give in to despair nor despise those who mistreat her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince, not merely an apprentice at the Palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul. It appears her fortunes may be about to change when the Palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball, raising Ella's hopes of once again encountering the charming Kit (Richard Madden). Alas, her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress. But, as in all good fairy tales, help is at hand, and a kindly beggar woman (Helena Bonham Carter) steps forward and – armed with a pumpkin and a few mice – changes Cinderella's life forever. A live-action feature inspired by the classic fairy tale, ""Cinderella"" brings to life the timeless images from Disney's 1950 animated masterpiece as fully realized characters in a visually dazzling spectacle for a whole new generation.

When he meets Vaidehi Trivedi, he believes he has found the ideal bride. But Vaidehi is an aspirational girl, from Kota (Rajasthan), trying to fight her way out of the male dominant world she has grown up in. She craves independence and an individual identity, something most small town Indian girls don’t have the luxury to dream off. For Badri, Vaidehi’s dreams are more conversations rather than a practical way of life, but he continues to entertain them just to woo her. Vaidehi is trying hard to be the son of her family, but is constantly bombarded with the realities of small town India, where for a woman, a happy married life is given more importance than a career. Badrinath Ki Dulhania is the story of these two opposites. Their interactions lead to humor, difference of opinions and conflicts, which are against the moral fabric of MCP’s in general. But ultimately it’s a film about understanding and realization. Badri understands that the role of women in society is very different from what he had grown up seeing and he comes to admire and appreciate their potential. Vaidehi realizes that Badri’s MCP attitude is not his, but a product of his upbringing and underneath it all lies a simple boy looking for love and true companionship. Here in lies the essence of the film. CBFC U/A (DIL/2/58/2017-MUM)",YouTube Movies,,30,,2017-06-25T14:00:01Z,PT2H19M2S,0,2889,true,,
